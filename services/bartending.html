    description: "If you are having a private party, this is a fun way to make your guests feel special. We work with you ahead of time to establish the beverage menu of your choice. Once that is selected, we will bring all necessary supplies to bring some excitement to your party. You just need to sit back, take a sip and enjoy. We will even assist any other hosting duties if needed!"
