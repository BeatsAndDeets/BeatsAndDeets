- quote: Adam has been the DJ for countless professional and family gatherings I have attended over the years and I cannot say enough good things about him! Not only is he incredibly professional, but he goes out of his way to make sure that you and your guests are getting the best experience possible. He provided the music for my mother's retirement party last night and I have heard nothing but rave reviews from her and the other guests since it ended late last night! Music can truly make or break the tone of a gathering and Adam always manages to get it just right. I look forward to using him again in the near future. As always Adam, THANK YOU!!

- quote: Bear and Jake we such a great addition at our wedding. My dad is a musician so really wanted live music to be part of it. They played such a diverse mix that appealed to both me and my fianc√©, as well as my dad. They are very easy to work with and very professional. Booking live music could be a scary thought but rest assured with these guys!
